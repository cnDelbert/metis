# METIS

METIS is a set of serial programs for partitioning graphs, partitioning finite element meshes, and producing fill reducing orderings for sparse matrices. The algorithms implemented in METIS are based on the multilevel recursive-bisection, multilevel *k*-way, and multi-constraint partitioning schemes developed in Karypis Lab.
